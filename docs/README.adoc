== abstract

this is a pretty bare bone dxf parser and will only give you the parsed dxf file as struct
and from there on you are on your own. So basic dxf knowledge is needed to use it. A better
documentation for dxf can be found at https://ezdxf.mozman.at/docs/dxfentities/index.html[mozman's docs^].

== examples

this parser has zero dependencies and will continue to have none and is also pretty easy to integrate
in a website via webassembly there is also an example in the examples folder showing how to use the wasm package.
